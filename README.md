## 📋 Description

**VPN Deck** is a Decky Loader plugin that lets you manage VPN via AmneziaWG directly from Steam Deck gaming mode:

- Config import — add VPN from a `.conf` file through the plugin UI
- Multiple configs — store and switch between multiple VPN connections
- Enable/disable each config with a single toggle
- Real-time connection status
- Error history with the ability to clear it

The plugin requires root access to work with `awg-quick` and network interfaces.

### ⚠️ Important: Limitations

**In version 2, the plugin does not manage the `awg0` interface.** Only configs added through the plugin are managed (interfaces named `vd-<name>`).

Configs imported through the plugin are stored in `~/.local/share/vpn-deck/configs`; symlinks are created in `/etc/amnezia/amneziawg/`. AmneziaWG binaries are included in the plugin release — no separate installation required.

## Changes between v1 and v2

| | v1 | v2 |
|---|----|----|
| **Interface** | Managed only one `awg0` interface via `systemctl` | Does **not** manage `awg0`. Only configs added through the plugin (`vd-*` interfaces) |
| **Setup** | Config had to be set up manually in Desktop Mode (building amneziawg-go/awg-quick, creating `awg0.conf`, symlinks) | Configs are imported from UI (`.conf` file). Binaries are included in the release |
| **Configs** | One config (`awg0`) | Multiple configs named `vd-<name>` |

If you were using v1 with `awg0`, after upgrading to v2 the plugin will no longer bring up or stop that interface. To manage VPN through the plugin, re-import your config via "Import config".

## 📥 Installation

Install the plugin **only from official releases** on GitHub.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **The plugin requires an AmneziaWG v1 config.** AmneziaWG v2 protocol is not supported.
> The config must be in **AmneziaWG native format** (a WireGuard-like `.conf` file with `Jc`, `Jmin`, `Jmax`, etc. fields). In the AmneziaVPN app, make sure to select **"AmneziaWG native format"** when exporting — it is not the default.

**Before removing the plugin or installing a new version, turn off VPN in the plugin itself** (set the toggle next to the active config to "off"). Otherwise, the update or removal may fail.

1. Open [Releases](https://github.com/mrwaip/vpn-deck/releases) and download the latest release (`vpn-deck-v*.zip`).
2. Copy the ZIP to your Steam Deck, open Decky Loader → plugin settings → "Install plugin" → specify the path to the file.

**After installation:** open the plugin in gaming mode → "Import config" → select a `.conf` file (e.g., from the Downloads folder). After import, the config will appear in the list and can be toggled on/off.

### How to transfer a config to Steam Deck

You need to transfer the `.conf` file to the Deck in order to select it in the plugin:

- **LocalSend** — install the app on your phone/PC and on the Deck (from Discover in Desktop Mode). Send the `.conf` file to the Deck; it will land in Downloads.
- **Desktop Mode + browser** — switch to Desktop Mode, open a browser, download the config (or save it from email/messenger) to the Downloads folder. In gaming mode, specify the path to this file in the plugin (e.g., `/home/deck/Downloads/name.conf`).

## Usage

- **Import config** — "Import config" button, select a `.conf` file. Config name: up to 12 characters (letters, digits, `_`, `=`, `+`, `.`, `-`).
- **Enable/disable** — toggle next to the config name.
- **Delete config** — "Delete config" under the desired config (the interface will be stopped).
- **Errors** — "Errors" section: view history and clear it with "Clear error history".
